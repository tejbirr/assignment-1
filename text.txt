- REST documentation = population of contries for the endpoint 

- endpoint = is where you post your query altså interogate 
- documentation = is basically starting point of how to use and interact with that service
JSAON = DATA transfer form (origins main purpose)
- Jason is a format which u can use to send data from server to client and from client to server even when u want to post(store) data.

dynamic server (where u generate data)
API = will connect u and the dynamic server
u have to create a servelete and a client will send u a request. then this servelete will give u the data. 
altså REQ and RES (web page or HTML page)
siden du er ikke i Browseren så du trnger ikke hele web pagen men bare data inn i mobil appen din (værapp) 
så da får du tilbake Enten JSAON eller XML format 
i JSAON u create a object on the server side and therefore can just send the state of an object (data) for the app 
So converting an object into a state and sending the state of an object (data) thats called a Representational state Transfer (REST).  

CRUD Operation (Create, Read, Update and Delete) the resource = resource means (add?num1=num2/something) this means getting data from a resource.

 POSTMAN = debugging, developing and testing ur application, cause it has his own test script syntax (use to write request to ur own services)
